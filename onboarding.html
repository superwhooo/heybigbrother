      <h2>Our Promise</h2>
      <p>It’s not that we don’t want to get to know you — we want you to feel safe being yourself, confident that your life is in your control.</p>
      <p>Our purpose isn’t to collect your personal life; it’s to help make the world around safer, for you and everyone you love.</p>
      <p>Big Brother’s purpose is insight-driven living, using anonymous patterns and community alerts to make your routes, your city, and your choices a little safer every day.</p>
