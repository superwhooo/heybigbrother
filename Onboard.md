ðŸ©µ BIG BROTHER â€“ Onboarding Flow (final copy)


---

0. Disclaimer

> In case of an active emergency, dial 112.
BIG BROTHER is not the police system.
We are a bridge â€” built to help you stay connected, and to make sure our safety systems are never overloaded or out of reach to anyone who may need it.

If you are ready, feeling safe and calm,
Say hey, BIG BROTHER.

1. Your Safety Is in Your Hands

> Your safety is in your hands â€”
and always trust your instincts.

Stay aware of your surroundings,
and remember, BIG BROTHER is your quiet companion, helping keep you safe, step by step.




---

2. Our Promise

> Our priority is to help keep you safe.
We arenâ€™t here to collect your personal life â€” weâ€™re here to remind you that you are in control.

Our purpose is to make the world safer
for you, your loved ones, and everyone around you.

BIG BROTHER is built on the idea of community as strength - using shared awareness and anonymous patterns to make your routes, your city, and your choices safer every day.

3. Your Part of the Promise

> By continuing, you agree to use BIG BROTHER responsibly:

â€¢ With respect for privacy. You will not try to access anyone elseâ€™s information.
You canâ€™t. We donâ€™t either.
â€¢ For genuine safety only. False alerts can divert real help from those who need it.
â€¢ With consent. Add Guardians only with their knowledge. An active guardian may make all the difference during times of need for you and may be someone else in need.
â€¢ With truth. The details you share during an alert help rescuers reach you faster.

What We Promise You in Return:
â€¢ We donâ€™t collect or sell your personal data.
â€¢ Your information stays on your device, shared only when help must reach you.
â€¢ You can delete your account data at any time.
â€¢ No unwanted emails or promotions â€” ever.
â€¢ Every feature you see exists only to keep you safe â€” nothing more, nothing less.

9. The Heartbeat

> The entire universe runs through you.

The red screen ripples softly â€” zooming out to reveal the pulsing heart at the center of it all: you.

Rings expand gently outward,
showing nearby Blips and your Guardians â€”
all connected in motion, steady and calm.

The world around you lights up as the heart beats. A soft voice or haptic pulse might whisper: Welcome to your safe space.

10. Welcome Screen / Dashboard Transition

> A gentle pulse continues at the center â€”
one of the ripples displays 112 faintly,
grounding the design in purpose.

The screen shifts smoothly from red to the clean dashboard interface.

[Transition: Home Screen (Dashboard) â€” Radar animation begins.]
