🩵 BIG BROTHER – Onboarding Flow (final copy)


---

0. Disclaimer

> In case of an active emergency, dial 112.
BIG BROTHER is not the police system.
We are a bridge — built to help you stay connected,
and to make sure safety systems are never overloaded or out of reach.

If you are ready, feeling safe and calm,
say hey, BIG BROTHER.




---

1. Your Safety Is in Your Hands

> Your safety is in your hands — and always trust your instincts.

Stay aware of your surroundings,
and remember, BIG BROTHER is your quiet companion,
helping keep you safe, step by step.




---

2. Our Promise

> We’re not here to collect your personal life.
Our priority is simple — to help keep you safe.

We’re here to remind you that you are in control,
and that feeling safe should never depend on constant monitoring.

BIG BROTHER is built on the idea that safety comes from connection —
that community is our greatest strength.

Our purpose is to make the world a little safer,
for you, your loved ones, and everyone else around us —
a single heartbeat at a time.

3. Your Part of the Promise

> By continuing, you agree to use BIG BROTHER responsibly:

• With respect for privacy. You will not try to access anyone else’s information.
You can’t. We don’t either.
• For genuine safety only. False alerts can divert real help from those who need it.
• With consent. Add Guardians only with their knowledge.
• With truth. The details you share during an alert help rescuers reach you faster.

What We Promise You in Return:
• We don’t collect or sell your personal data.
• Your information stays on your device, shared only when help must reach you.
• You can delete your account data at any time.
• No unwanted emails or promotions — ever.
• Every feature you see exists only to keep you safe — nothing more, nothing less.

4. Know Your Tools

> Learn how BIG BROTHER keeps you safe — one step at a time.

• Walk With Me: Lets your Guardians walk with you virtually until you reach home safely. View access is enabled only for the Guardians you select, and it automatically ends the moment you choose to stop sharing.

• Guardian Call: Sends a message directly to your chosen Guardian in case of concern.

• Panic: Long-press trigger to alert Guardians and record audio automatically.

• SOS: Triple-press to escalate directly to emergency services (112).

• Vault: Keeps sensitive data encrypted and under your control.

• Down Time: A guided moment to steady your breath and calm your heart.

• Blips: Anonymous users visible only when someone nearby needs help.

> Break-Glass:
In rare emergencies, authorised police officers can use a secure, time-limited access key — called Break-Glass — to help reach you faster when you cannot trigger an SOS yourself.

This feature is available only to verified law enforcement through official emergency channels.

Every use is recorded, audited, and independently reviewed to make sure it’s used correctly and never misused.

Think of it as a last-resort bridge between safety systems —
so that no one is ever left unseen when seconds matter.

5. Guardian Setup

> You are never alone.
BIG BROTHER is your circle of trust — built by you, around you, for you.

Before we begin, think of the people who make you feel safe.
Which one of yours will help us have your back?

Add as many Guardians as you’d like —
but to continue, start with your first.

On your map, each Guardian appears as a small heart outlined in brackets —
your anchor of safety.

6. Access & Permissions

> To help keep you safe, BIG BROTHER will require access to:

• Location: To guide responders when you need help.
• Motion & Sensors: For Down Time feedback and detecting sudden distress.
• Notifications: To alert your Guardians, remind you to breathe, and notify you if someone nearby needs help.
• Microphone: For recording audio during Panic or SOS mode — ensuring help hears what you can’t say.
• Biometric Sensor (optional): To visualize your heartbeat during calm moments in Down Time — helping you center yourself and feel grounded. Data stays on your device and is never stored.

These tools protect you.
The biometric feature helps you reconnect with yourself.

You’ll always be in control of what’s shared, and when.

and I will help others when I can —
without ever putting myself in harm’s way.

8. The Heartbeat

> The entire universe runs through you.

The red screen ripples softly — zooming out
to reveal the pulsing heart at the center: you.

Rings expand outward, showing nearby Blips and your Guardians —
all connected in calm motion.

As your heart beats, the world lights up.

“Welcome to your safe space.”




---

9. A Little Safer Today (Daily Affirmation)

> Even when there’s no emergency, safety starts with a breath.

A gentle line of text appears:
“One heartbeat at a time — that’s how safety begins.”

Each day, you’ll see a small message waiting for you.
Not a notification. Just a reminder that you’re not alone.

“You’ve kept yourself safe all this while — we’re just here for backup.”




---

10. Welcome Screen / Dashboard Transition

> The screen shifts from red to your clean dashboard.

One of the ripples quietly shows 112, grounding it in purpose.

The pulse continues at the center — steady and calm.

The world breathes with you.
