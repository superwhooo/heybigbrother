      <p>BIG BROTHER is not the police system.<br>
      We are a bridge — built to help you stay connected,<br>
      and to make sure safety systems are never overloaded or out of reach.</p>
      <p>If you are ready, feeling safe and calm,<br> say <strong>Hey, BIG BROTHER</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Your Safety Is in Your Hands</h2>

      Stay aware of your surroundings, and remember, BIG BROTHER is your quiet companion, helping keep you safe, step by step.</p>

      <h2>Our Promise</h2>
      <p>We’re not here to collect your personal life. Our priority is simple — to help keep you safe.<br>
      We’re here to remind you that you are in control, and that feeling safe should never depend on constant monitoring.</p>
      <p>BIG BROTHER is built on the idea that safety comes from connection — that community is our greatest strength.<br>
      Our purpose is to make the world a little safer for you, your loved ones, and everyone else around us, a single heartbeat at a time.</p>

      <h2>Your Part of the Promise</h2>
      <p>By continuing, you agree to use BIG BROTHER responsibly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>With respect for privacy. You will not try to access anyone else’s information. You can’t. We don’t either.</li>
        <li>For genuine safety only. False alerts can divert real help from those who need it.</li>
        <li>With consent. Add Guardians only with their knowledge.</li>
        <li>With truth. The details you share during an alert help rescuers reach you faster.</li>

      <p>What We Promise You in Return:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We don’t collect or sell your personal data.</li>
        <li>Your information stays on your device, shared only when help must reach you.</li>
