## 1. Vision

Big Brother (BB) / User Generated Care (UGC) is a **collaborative civic-tech framework** where creative human insight and adaptive intelligence come together to improve **safe, connected living**.  

We are building a bridge between citizens, communities, and public agencies — a digital companion that listens, calms, guides, and, when required, connects users to real-world help with empathy and accountability.

## 2. Why we exist

> “Sometimes the smallest signal can save a life.”

Our goal is to transform how safety and care are experienced:
- Making help approachable, not intimidating.  
- Turning technology into trust, not surveillance.  
- Empowering individuals to act with empathy, and institutions to respond with precision.  

We design with **privacy first**, **open source transparency**, and **human warmth** at the center.
