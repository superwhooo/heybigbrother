### ❤️ Our Promise
We believe technology should protect, not intrude.  
BIG BROTHER exists to make sure no one ever feels alone when it matters most.  
Every alert, every blip, every heartbeat on our radar — that’s someone’s story, and we’re here to help keep them safe.

---

### 🧩 Overview  
**Big Brother** is a safety companion designed for modern India —  
built on empathy, privacy, and human connection.  
We’re not the system; we’re an **aid to it.**  
Our purpose: to make every moment *a little safer.*

---

### 💡 Core Philosophy  
> “Your safety is in your hands. We’re here to help make life a little safer.  
> Not to monitor, but to protect.”

- **Privacy-first**: No personal data is collected or sold.  
- **Guardian mesh**: You and your loved ones stay connected when it matters most.  
- **Insight-driven safety**: Anonymous patterns help communities become safer together.  
- **Human warmth, digital intelligence**: Designed to *feel* like care, not control.

### 🛡️ Guiding Promise
With respect for privacy.  
You will not try to access anyone else’s information.  
**You can’t. We don’t either.**

---

### 🧩 Compliance and Data Ethics
BIG BROTHER follows the principles of:
- **Data Minimization:** Only store what’s essential for safety response.
- **Sovereign Storage:** All information hosted within India.
- **Voluntary Consent:** Guardians and data sharing require explicit user permission.
- **Auditability:** All emergency overrides (police use) are logged and reviewed.

> “Privacy is not a feature — it’s the foundation.”
