# BIG BROTHER Brandbook

## Visual Philosophy
BIG BROTHER is built around calm vigilance — design that reassures, not alarms.  
Colors, motion, and typography together create a language of *presence*, not panic.

### Core Design Elements
- **Logo**: Minimal, outlined, always centered on human connection.
- **Color**: Red for action, navy for stability, white for clarity.
- **Typography**: Poppins — clear, accessible, global.
- **Motion**: Circular ripples symbolizing awareness, unity, and response.

### Usage
- The brand assets are licensed for safety-related integrations and verified partnerships.
- The BB logo should never be recolored or placed on chaotic backgrounds.
- The pulse animation is a signature and must remain consistent.
